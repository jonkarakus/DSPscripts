# DSP Scripts

## Project Overview
Developed by Jon Karakus, the `DSPscripts` repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts that demonstrate core Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques. These scripts are intended to serve as foundational tools for further exploration into advanced DSP applications, like noise cancellation and spectral analysis.

## Objectives
- **Foundational Learning**: Provide clear examples of basic DSP techniques through MATLAB scripting. Establish a base for more complex DSP applications

## Methodology
### Adaptive Filtering
- Utilizes the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm to adaptively filter noise from signals.

### Quantization
- Demonstrates the effects of signal quantization and its implications on signal integrity.

### Noise Cancellation
- Comb filtering compared to LMS filtering to effectively reduce noise in real-time applications.

### Spectral Estimation
- Implements Welch's method to estimate the power spectrum of a signal, aiding in the analysis of its frequency components.
